Harvard-App
===========
Unofficial Harvard app that I built for my first semester of Intro to Computer Science at Harvard.

The menu portion shows what  is in the dining hall and updates the tiles with that information.

The shuttle tracker allows you to find the next shuttle between two points.

The map is still in development, but hopefully Bing Maps API will allow one to search for places with ease at Harvard.
